<h2>Functions</h2>

* Functions allow you to group commonly used code into a compact unit that can be used repeatedly.

Example:

``` float triangle(float width, float height) ```

The **float** is the function type. This defines the type of data returned by the function. ```width``` and ``height`` are the **parameters** to the function. Parameters are variables local to the function that are used to pass information into the function.
