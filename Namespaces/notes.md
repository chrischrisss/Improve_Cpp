<h2>Namespace</h2>

* C++ lets you define something called a namespace
* All variables declared inside a namespace are considered to be memebers of the same family, or namespace

Example 1 in ```main.cpp```

The C++ equivalent of a full name is something called a fully qualified name. In Example 1, the fully qualified name of the variable ```width``` is ```display::width```
